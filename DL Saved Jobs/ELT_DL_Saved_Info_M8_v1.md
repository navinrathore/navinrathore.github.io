# Data Mart: Mapping Info SAVED (ELT_DL_Saved_Info_M8_v1)

## Intent
Purpose of this component is to copy all the records corresponding to the input `DL_ID` from the table `ELT_DL_Mapping_Info_Saved` to the table `ELT_DL_Mapping_Info`.

## DB Connection 

Once the Input parameters are read into the system, the database connection is established using the provided details â€” such as URL, username, password, and properties. 

 - Auto commit should be enabled.
 - The database connection must be properly closed at the end of the operation.

 ## Input Specifications
The component or service is dependent on the following input data:

- App DB Connection Details
- DL_Id - table id

## Component 1: Copy Records into `ELT_DL_Mapping_Info`

### Fetch and Copy the Records
Fetch the relevant data from `ELT_DL_Mapping_Info_Saved` and copy them into `ELT_DL_Mapping_Info_Saved`. As there is no modification in data, the following methodology can be used to fetch and copy the relevant records, at once. See additional Details below for list of the fields. Also, before copying delete all the relevant data from the table `ELT_DL_Mapping_Info`.

```sql
INSERT INTO target_table (column1, column2, column3, ...)
SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
FROM source_table
WHERE condition;
```

In the talend job, following fields are fetched and copied

```sql
"SELECT 
  `ELT_DL_Mapping_Info_Saved`.`DL_Id`, 
  `ELT_DL_Mapping_Info_Saved`.`DL_Name`, 
  `ELT_DL_Mapping_Info_Saved`.`DL_Column_Names`, 
  `ELT_DL_Mapping_Info_Saved`.`Constraints`, 
  `ELT_DL_Mapping_Info_Saved`.`DL_Data_Types`, 
  `ELT_DL_Mapping_Info_Saved`.`Column_Type`, 
  `ELT_DL_Mapping_Info_Saved`.`Added_Date`, 
  `ELT_DL_Mapping_Info_Saved`.`Added_User`, 
  `ELT_DL_Mapping_Info_Saved`.`Updated_Date`, 
  `ELT_DL_Mapping_Info_Saved`.`Updated_User`
FROM `ELT_DL_Mapping_Info_Saved`
where DL_Id='"+context.DL_Id+"'"
```
Before inserting the records, all existing relevant records are purged.

```sql
     "Delete from ELT_DL_Mapping_Info  where DL_Id='"+context.DL_Id+"'"
```

</details>

The schematic of the job is shown in the [attached diagram](#appendix-a).
